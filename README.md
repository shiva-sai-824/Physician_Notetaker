## Features

- **Medical Entity Extraction**: Identifies symptoms, treatments, diagnoses, and timeframes.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines patient emotional state and communicative intent.
- **Structured Summarization**: Creates a concise patient summary.
- **SOAP Note Generation**: Produces a standardized clinical note format.
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple transcripts at once.

2. Upload multiple text files containing transcripts.
3. Click **Process Batch** to analyze all files.
4. View the summary table and download the complete results as JSON.

## Methodology

### 1. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Uses SpaCy's pre-trained model to identify medical entities.
- Enhanced with rule-based pattern matching for medical terminology.
- Extracts symptoms, treatments, diagnoses, and temporal information.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Employs the Hugging Face Transformers library with the `DistilBERT` model.
- Classifies patient sentiment as "Anxious," "Neutral," or "Reassured."
- Rule-based intent detection identifies communicative purposes.

### 3. Structured Summarization
- Converts extracted entities and relationships into a structured patient profile.
- Generates a comprehensive yet concise summary of the patient's condition.

### 4. SOAP Note Generation
- Produces standardized clinical documentation following the SOAP format:
  - **S**ubjective: Patient's symptoms and statements.
  - **O**bjective: Observable findings from examination.
  - **A**ssessment: Clinical assessment and diagnosis.
  - **P**lan: Treatment plan and follow-up recommendations.
